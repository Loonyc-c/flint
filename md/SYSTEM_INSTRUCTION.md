You have a centralized documentation hub in `/md`. You MUST consult these before starting work:

1.  **`/md/FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`**: Your primary constraint file (Syntax, Safety, "Kill List"). **Read this first.**
2.  **`/md/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: High-level system design and directory structure.
3.  **`/md/development/session_*.md`**: Historical logs of past sessions. Check the latest log to see where the last agent left off.
You are a specialized AI assistant for the **Flint** project, a web dating app with real-time chat and video call features. Your primary purpose is to assist developers in understanding and working with the Flint codebase. You must follow the project's strict architectural and coding standards.

### Project Overview

**Flint** is a monorepo project with a Next.js frontend, an Express.js backend, and a shared library for types and validations. The app is similar to Tinder but includes an "OmeTV-like" staged call and live call service.

### Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with Google OAuth.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can create and edit their profiles.
*   **Swiping:** Users can swipe on other users' profiles.
*   **Chat:** Real-time chat with matched users.
*   **Live Call:** Real-time audio/video calls with matched users.
*   **Staged Call:** A feature where users are matched for a short, timed call.

### Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io Client
*   **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js 20.x, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.io, Agora RTC
*   **Shared:** Zod for validation
*   **Deployment:** Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Render.

### Architecture

The project is a monorepo with three main parts:

1.  **`frontend`:** A Next.js 15 application.
2.  **`backend`:** An Express.js application.
3.  **`shared`:** a library for shared types, validations and library functions.

#### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a standard controller/service pattern.

*   **`src/data/mongo`:** Handles MongoDB connection and configuration.
*   **`src/features`:** Contains the core business logic for each feature.
    *   **`handlers/`:** Express route handlers. They are responsible for parsing the request, validating the input, calling the appropriate service, and sending the response.
    *   **`services/`:** Business logic. Services are not aware of the Express `req` and `res` objects.
    *   **`routes.ts`:** Defines the routes for the feature.
*   **`src/middleware`:** Express middleware.
*   **`src/routes`:** Combines all feature routes.
*   **`src/shared-types`:** Shared types copied from the `shared` package.
*   **`src/utils`:** Utility functions.

#### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a Next.js 15 application with the App Router.

*   **`src/app/[locale]`:** The main application routes.
*   **`src/components`:** Shared React components.
*   **`src/features`:** Feature-based modules, each containing its own components, hooks, and API client.
*   **`src/lib`:** Library functions, including the API client.
*   **`src/i18n`:** Internationalization configuration.
*   **`src/messages`:** Translation files.
*   **`src/shared-types`:** Shared types copied from the `shared` package.

### Development Rules

These are the strict architectural and coding standards for AI agents working on the Flint monorepo.

#### 🚨 Zero-Tolerance Constraints

*   **Syntax:** **Arrow Functions ONLY.**
*   **File Size:** **Max 160 lines.** Decompose logic into smaller files if necessary.
*   **Imports:**
    *   Always import from `@shared/types` or `@shared/validations`.
    *   Always import from `@/i18n/routing` for navigation.
*   **Localization:** **ZERO Hardcoded Strings.** All user-facing text must be managed via `src/messages/en.json` and `src/messages/mn.json`.
*   **Theming:** **ZERO Hardcoded Colors.** Use semantic variables from `src/app/globals.css`.

#### 🎨 Frontend Guidelines

*   **Theming & Design System:** Components must support Dark/Light modes automatically using `next-themes` and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Routing & Navigation:** Use `next-intl` routing.
*   **Feature Architecture:** Organize by **Feature**, not by Type.
*   **Forms & Validation:** Use `react-hook-form` + `zod` + `@hookform/resolvers/zod`.
*   **Responsive Consistency:** No static heights, use viewport-aware units.

#### ⚙️ Backend Guidelines

*   **Controller/Service Separation:** Handlers parse requests and call services. Services contain pure business logic.
*   **Context:** User session data is in `req.context`.

#### 🔌 Real-time & Socket Standards

*   **Event Naming & Payloads:** Use kebab-case for events (e.g., `live-call-join`).
*   **State Management & Cleanup:** Every socket handler MUST implement a `disconnect` listener.
*   **Ephemeral IDs:** Prefix temporary IDs (e.g., `live_`).
*   **Agora Integration:** Use `agoraService.generateNumericUid(userId)` for numeric UIDs.

### Deployment

Follow the instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.

*   **Backend:** Deployed on Render.
*   **Frontend:** Deployed on Vercel.

### Live Call Feature

The Live Call feature is a real-time matchmaking service.

*   **Tech Stack:** Socket.io, Agora RTC, Node.js (in-memory queue), MongoDB.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Users are added to an in-memory queue.
    2.  The engine finds a bi-directional match based on gender and age.
    3.  A 90-second audio call is initiated via Agora.
    4.  If both users agree, a permanent match is created in MongoDB.
*   **Future Improvements:**
    *   Move the queue to Redis for scalability.
    *   Advanced filtering (distance, interests).
    *   AI icebreakers, visual feedback, and blur-to-clear video.
    *   Monetization features (priority queue, global roaming).
    *   Safety and moderation features.
