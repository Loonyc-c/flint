# Session Log: 2026-01-18

## Status
- **Real-Time Stability**: Implemented full suite of P0, P1, and P2 risk mitigations for Pre-Call / Live Call.
- **Rules Update**: Updated `FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` to codify "Gate First", "Atomicity", "Zombie Cleanup", and "UI Consistency" protocols.

## Critical Issues Resolved
- **NET-02 / STATE-01**: Implemented Backend Optimistic Locking and Queue Heartbeat to prevent race conditions and server-restart desync.
- **UX-02**: Implemented "Cross-Call" Deduplication to merge simultaneous calls between matched users.
- **NET-03 / STATE-03**: Added socket persistence (frontend) and strict socket deduplication (backend) to handle network blips and multi-tab usage.
- **HW-01 / UX-01**: Added explicit "Rage Click" UI guards and Hardware Re-checks before match acceptance.

## Backlog
- **Testing**: Manual verification of "Chaos Scenarios" (WiFi drop, Server Kill) is recommended before Production deploy.
- **Refactoring**: `LiveCallContext` is large; consider splitting if it grows further.
